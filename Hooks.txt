 Hooks
=======

Chandler aims to offer a high level of customization using Hooks_,
thin wrappers around `setuptools' entry points`_.

Chandler features that rely on Hooks_ can be extended or changed by
adding or removing entry points.

Main hooks
==========

Below are Chandler's most frequently used Hooks.  See the index_ for a
complete list.

..
  When documenting a hook, add a Sphinx index directive, like
  .. index:: hook; hook_name (used by module_name) or
  .. index:: hook; hook_name (registered by module_name)
  If the hook is a major part of Chandler's behavior, add a section here,
  and use :ref: to link to associated use and registration documentation.


.. index:: hook; triage_position

Triage position
---------------

*chandler.hook.triage_position*  provides callables like:

.. describe:: triage_position_callable(entry) -> (weight, position)

   Return (-1, None) if triage_position can't be calculated for the
   entry, otherwise a float weight and position timestamp.

.. seealso::

      ..

   :ref:`event-triage-position`
      ..
